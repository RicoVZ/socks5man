Socks5man is a Socks5 management tool and Python library. It
enables you to add socks5 servers, run a service that verifies if
they are operational, and request these servers in a round-robin fashion
by country, city, average connection time, and bandwidth, using the Python library.

The library also allows for manual operationality, bandwidth, and connection time tests.
A local database is used to lookup country and city information for a host ip.
